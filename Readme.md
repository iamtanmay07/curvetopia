# Project Title: Curvetopia - Shape Identification

## Project Overview
Curvetopia is a Python-based project designed to identify and classify geometric shapes from given data sets. This project primarily utilizes Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate the application of various geometric algorithms to recognize shapes such as circles, rectangles, ellipses, and more.

## Features
- **Shape Detection**: Identify multiple geometric shapes from input data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize input data and the results of shape identification.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Easily extendable for additional shapes or enhanced algorithms.
